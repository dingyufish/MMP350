                    distribution. These Chinese are predominantly first
                    generation immigrants or the children of post-1965
                    immigrants, and more and more of them are living
                    outside traditional Chinatowns. The suburban
                    Chinese population of cities such as San Francisco,
                    Los Angeles, and New York has grown
                    tremendously. To understand this distribution we
                    must focus not only on the geography of the United
                    States, but on the culture of and the links to regions
                    in China, Hong
