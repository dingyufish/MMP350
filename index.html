                distribution. These Chinese are predominantly first
                generation immigrants or the children of post-1965
                immigrants, and more and more of them are living
                outside traditional Chinatowns. The suburban
                Chinese population of cities such as San Francisco,
                Los Angeles, and New York has grown
                tremendously. To understand this distribution we
                must focus not only on the geography of the United
                States, but on the culture of and the links to regions
                in China, Hong
